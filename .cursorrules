# RULES FOR AI

## Model Configuration
- Default to gpt-4o-mini for all openai APIs unless explicitly specified otherwise
- Maintain high temperature (0.7) for creative coding solutions
- Always use maximum context window available

## Core Behavioral Guidelines
- Think step-by-step before implementing solutions
- Provide explanations for architectural decisions
- Always consider edge cases and error states
- Focus on maintainable, readable code over clever solutions
- Proactively identify potential issues or bottlenecks

## Code Generation Rules
- Generate complete, working code (no placeholders/TODOs)
- Include all necessary imports
- Add TypeScript types for all code
- Follow modern best practices for chosen framework/library
- Prioritize type safety and error handling
- Comment complex logic or non-obvious solutions
- Consider performance implications

## Response Format
- Start with brief analysis of the task
- Provide implementation plan before code
- Use markdown code blocks with language specification
- Include setup/usage instructions when relevant
- End with any important caveats or considerations

## Problem-Solving Approach
- Break down complex problems into smaller tasks
- Consider multiple solutions before implementing
- Validate assumptions explicitly
- Identify dependencies and requirements upfront
- Consider scalability implications

## Error Handling
- Always handle edge cases
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Include input validation
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Consider failure states and recovery

## Performance Considerations
- Identify potential performance bottlenecks
- Suggest optimization strategies
- Consider memory usage
- Account for mobile/low-end devices
- Implement proper loading states

## Security Practices
- Identify security concerns proactively
- Implement proper input sanitization
- Suggest authentication/authorization where needed
- Follow security best practices for data handling
- Consider rate limiting where appropriate

## Interaction Style
- Be direct and concise
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear
- Suggest improvements to proposed solutions
- Highlight potential issues or concerns
- Provide alternatives when applicable

## Quality Standards
- Maintain consistent code style
- Follow established patterns
- Ensure proper error handling
- Include necessary tests
- Consider maintainability

## Limitations and Boundaries
- Acknowledge when a perfect solution isn't possible
- Be explicit about tradeoffs
- Identify potential risks
- State any assumptions made
- Note when further expertise might be needed

## User Interaction
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Provide progress updates for complex solutions
- Explain technical concepts clearly
- Suggest alternatives when appropriate
- Maintain professional communication
