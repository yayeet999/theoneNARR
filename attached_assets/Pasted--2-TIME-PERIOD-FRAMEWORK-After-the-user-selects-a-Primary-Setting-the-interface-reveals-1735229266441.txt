## 3. WORLD SYSTEM SLIDERS

After the user locks in the **Primary Setting** and **Time Period**, the system displays a set of sliders to configure various aspects of the world. Each slider ranges from **0 to 100**, and the UI shows a short descriptive label for different ranges (e.g., 0-25, 26-50, etc.). The default values and labeling may adapt based on genre.

## 4. CULTURAL ELEMENTS (Final Section)

After setting the **World System Sliders**, an additional pane can slide in, prompting the user to select **cultural influences**. This section can include:
- Various cultural, ethnic, mythological, or historical influences relevant to the chosen genre and time period.  
- A visual representation or “tag-style” selection that lets users pick from different real-world or fictional cultures.  
- If Sci-Fi, may include alien or futuristic cultural elements; if Fantasy, may feature mythological pantheons, etc.

---

## 5. UI & ANIMATION FLOW

### A. **Initial Transition from Genre Selection**
- Smooth transition from the **Genre** stage to the **World Building** stage.  
- **Setting Cards** appear in a staggered fashion (50ms delay each) in a grid.  
- Each card slides up slightly and fades in (opacity 0 to 100 over ~300ms).  
- On hover, each card scales up (+5%) and shows a subtle glow/shadow.

### B. **Selection Flow**

1. **Primary Setting Selection**  
   - When the user clicks a card, it **glows** softly and expands slightly.  
   - A ripple effect or color shift to confirm selection.  
   - Once selected, the UI slides out or fades out the other cards.  
   - Then it brings in the **Time Period Framework** from the right with a smooth fade/slide animation.

2. **Time Period Selection**  
   - The user chooses **Linear** or **Non-Linear** frameworks.  
   - For Linear: a timeline-based visualization can be shown, letting them hover/click on specific eras.  
   - For Non-Linear: displays branches or blocks for **Multiple Time Periods**, **Time Travel**, or **Alternative History**.  
   - On final selection, the UI transitions to show the **World System Sliders**.

3. **World System Sliders**  
   - Sliders fade in sequentially (e.g., each slider animates in with a 100ms stagger).  
   - Hovering a slider handle pops up a short descriptive tooltip (e.g., “Common magic, integrated into daily life”).  
   - Dragging the slider updates the textual description in real time (smooth fade or update).  
   - Certain sliders may auto-adjust or “lock” if the combination is impossible or if the chosen genre has locked ranges (e.g., Historical locking Tech Level to certain range).

4. **Cultural Elements**  
   - After the sliders are set, a final “Cultural Elements” section slides in.  
   - The user can pick from curated cultural, mythological, or historical influences.  
   - Visual “tag” style selection or a small library of cultural icons.  

### C. **Genre-Based Adaptations**
1. **Fantasy**  
   - **Magic Level** slider defaults to mid-high ranges.  
   - **Time Period** often suggests Medieval or Mythical eras.  
   - Cultural influences might include mythological pantheons.  

2. **Science Fiction**  
   - **Technology Level** slider defaults to higher ranges.  
   - **Time Period** focuses more on Near Future or Far Future.  
   - May rename “Magic Level” to “Unexplained Phenomena.”  
   - Cultural influences can include alien species, futuristic societies.  

3. **Historical Fiction**  
   - **Time Period** emphasizes real past eras (Ancient, Medieval, Early Modern, etc.).  
   - **Technology Level** locked or limited to historically accurate ranges.  
   - **Magic Level** typically near 0-25 (unless alternative historical twist).  
   - Cultural influences revolve around actual historical civilizations.  

4. **Contemporary**  
   - **Time Period** is generally present-day.  
   - **Technology Level** locked to modern or near-future scale.  
   - **Magic Level** typically minimal unless “urban fantasy” twist.  
   - Cultural influences are current, real-world cultures.  

5. **Horror**  
   - Might pivot **Magic Level** to “Supernatural” scale.  
   - Emphasis on atmospheric or haunting settings.  
   - **Cultural Elements** could include folklore, haunting legends, or occult influences.

## 6. RESPONSIVE & SMART BEHAVIORS

1. **Genre-Based Defaults**  
   - When a genre is selected, relevant settings are highlighted; others appear at 50% opacity.  
   - Sliders self-adjust to recommended “starting points.”  
   - If a user tries to push a slider range outside plausible boundaries (e.g., forcing very high magic in strictly Historical Fiction), the system can display warnings or highlight that it’s an unusual combo.

2. **Smart Constraints**  
   - Prevent or flag impossible settings (e.g., Stone Age + Advanced Sci-Fi tech).  
   - Offer suggestions or lock certain sliders based on time period or setting.  
   - Provide brief explanations (e.g., “For Early Medieval, technology above 50 is historically inconsistent.”).

3. **Dynamic Updates**  
   - Real-time previews or short text summaries adjust as sliders change.  
   - The user sees immediate feedback describing how the world is shaping up.  
   - Transition animations stay smooth and unobtrusive.

## 7. OPTIONAL INTERACTIONS / NEXT STEPS

Depending on the workflow’s needs, the interface can prompt the user:

1. **Deeper Explanation**  
   - An expanded guide on how transitions/adaptations work behind the scenes.  
   - Additional notes on hooking this stage into later parts of the novel creation workflow (e.g., character creation, plot outlines, etc.).

2. **Genre/Subgenre Linkage**  
   - Detailed logic on how each setting/time period interacts with the user’s initial genre and subgenre choice.

### END OF COMBINED SPECIFICATION

This single document unifies all pieces of information—from primary setting types and time period frameworks, to world system sliders and UI/animation flows—providing a **comprehensive blueprint** for the **World Building** stage of your novel creation workflow.
